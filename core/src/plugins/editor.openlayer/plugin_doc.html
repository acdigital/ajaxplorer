The view uses Open Street Map by default, you must add the line
<pre>
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=false"></script>
</pre>
inside the main application template (plugins/gui.ajax/html/gui.html) if you want to enable Google Maps. Warning their API
has now turned into a commercial thing for a given volume.
