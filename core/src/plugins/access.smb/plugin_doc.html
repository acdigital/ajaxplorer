<p>Connect a Samba share and browse its files and folders. This plugin is based on a php wrapper around the command line tool smbclient. This tool must be installed on the server and accessible in the machine path. If you want to manually set the path to the <b>smbclient</b> program, edit the plugin global configuration.<br/>For a repository, a typical configuration can be Host : <b>192.168.0.25</b> Uri : <b>Share</b></p>
<p>Like the ftp access driver with the auth.ftp, this smb driver can be used in conjunction with the auth.smb plugin to authenticate users directly against the samba share.</p>
<p>The wrapper was first developped by Victor M. Varela.</p>
