<p>This plugin is an empty container for demonstrating how to create a simple plugin. It is disabled by default. If enabled, will simply add a button to the application toolbar that opens an external URL.</p>
<p>It covers standard features of plugins, included internationalisation and embedded images libraries. You should naturally read the developer doc in conjunction with the study of this plugin code to understand how it works!</p>
<p>It could be used in a middle term to automatically generate a new empty plugin, but for the moment if you duplicate this plugin to write your own, you'll have to grep the file names and plugin ids to make sure not to mess up with the original plugin.. For example, let's say your plugin is "action.gotomysite" :
<ul>
    <li>Rename the plugin folder</li>
    <li>Edit the manifest.xml file and replace <b>skeleton</b> by to <b>gotomysite</b> everywhere.</li>
    <li>Rename the javascript and PHP classes with names and filenames more adequate to your new plugin, and update the manifest.xml file accordingly</li>
    <li>Etc</li>
</ul>
