AjaXplorer Core 3.3.5

This release is an important security fix for a problem introduced in the 3.3.X branch. If you do not wish to upgrade,
please at least remove the current version of the editor.zoho plugin.

[Main Features]
Security problem fixed in editor.zoho plugin
XML Registry W3C Schema (XSD) for simpler manifest.xml edition
Internationalization of all the parameters defined in the XML files.
Better startup screen / include login errors in login screen instead of js alert
Performances hunting : lazy loading of many inclusions, of messages array, lightweight version of the registry (extended vs. light) to avoid
parsing user XML when not necessary (ie most of the time...).
New Http client for supporting HTTPS / Should replace HttpClient calls everywhere
Full rewrite of the Zoho plugin

[Uploader]
Better UX / Change default behaviour in plugin options
Use parameters "expose" attribute instead of bootstrapParameters when possible.
Missing decoding at upload!

[Misc]
Do not use __DIR__, introduces a php5.3 dependancy
Fix line breaks in a cleaner way at various points (php or xml serialization)
Rawurlencode() login & password when sending through URL, to allow usage of "/" and other "@". Then decode in AJXP_Safe. Should be rechecked for
other plugins.
Fix the randomly not working submenu
Better error reporting for token expiration / Bookmarklet fixes
meta.user : Forgotten refactoring for stars rates
meta.exif : Silently ignore exif_read_data errors
editor.pixlr : Do not use host as check referer, as it's not anymore always pixlr.com. Pass a token via the save file URL, and verify it's the
same.
Fix email management
fix shadower error / css tweak
Optional parameter "extract" for update_i18n
Channel parameter for upgrade / display release note content

[Default configs]
Moving a full install : auto-rewrite cache if "requires" are out of sync (still to test live)
Do not enable Probe Real Size by default
Compute CLIENT_TIMEOUT_TIME default value
Add a note to explain how to force the flash uploader usage
