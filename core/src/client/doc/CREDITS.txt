[EXTERNAL LIBRARIES]
AjaXplorer was developed using various free libraries that are mentionned below. It is mainly an engineering work that used a lot of off-the-shelf components. Please check their websites!

++ ORIGINAL PHP SCRIPT ++
The original php script (simple file manager, no ajax gui) was called WebJeff File Manager and was developed 
by Jean-François Gazet.

All the zip/unzip functionnalities implemented are based on the excellent PclZip class developped by PhpConcept.
