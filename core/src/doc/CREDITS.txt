[EXTERNAL LIBRARIES]
AjaXplorer was developed using various free libraries that are mentionned below. It is mainly an engineering work that used a lot of off-the-shelf components. Please check their websites!

++ ORIGINAL PHP SCRIPT ++
The original php script (simple file manager, no ajax gui) was called WebJeff File Manager and was developed 
by Jean-François Gazet.

++ JAVASCRIPT FRAMEWORKS & PLUGINS ++
The Ajax client is mainly based on the prototype.js library.
However, for the splitter bars (frame emulation) and the rounded corners, I used at some points the jQuery 
library, with the following plugins developed by Dave Methvin : Splitter.js and Corner.js. Thanks Dave for the
good work!

++ WEBFX WIDGETS ++
The Ajax widgets used for the Tree (XLoadTree) and for table sorting and selection were developed by WebFX.

++ MODAL WINDOWS ++
The modal windows are done with a modification of the Leightbox script (itself a modification of lightbox.js).
